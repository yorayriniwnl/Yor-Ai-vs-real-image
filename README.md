## Dataset

The dataset consists of real and AI-generated landscape images.

**Sources:**
- Real images: Unsplash
- AI images: Generated using AI image generation tools

> Note: The full dataset is not included in this repository due to size and licensing constraints.

## Install dependencies

```bat
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Train the model

```bat
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe train_model.py
```

## Run the web application

```bat
RunFile.bat
```

## How It Works

1. The uploaded image is converted to grayscale and resized to 224x224.
2. Texture features are extracted using:
   - Local Binary Pattern (LBP)
   - Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM)
   - Noise variance and Laplacian variance
3. Features are standardized using a scaler.
4. A trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier predicts the class.
5. The result is displayed on the web interface with a confidence score.
   
## Model Performance

The SVM classifier achieved approximately **77-80% accuracy** on the curated dataset.

Performance may vary depending on dataset diversity and image quality.
